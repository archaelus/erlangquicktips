title: Erlang Memoize
author: Nick Gerakines
date: 27/09/2008

This is a small module that shows how to memoize function calls and arguments. There are some obvious holes in this design, mainly in how errors and exceptions are handled, but it was a fun learning project from when I was first getting into Erlang. Again, gb_trees are used but a more effecient data structure could probably be used. There are no tests.
