title: Upgrading mnesia tables

For [Calenderl About Nothing](http://calenderlaboutnothing.com/) I needed to add a new field to one of the core records being stored in mnesia. Actually doing it is trivial but it is the sort of 'measure twice, cut once' thing and I didn't want to muck it up. I also took this opportunity to upgrade all of the plain list strings to binary strings to see what impact it would have on performance. This is the snippet that I used:

For better or worse, I just executed this code within the production node. It took a long time to run, but it did the job.
