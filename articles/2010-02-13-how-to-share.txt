So, you want to help out?

Adding a snippet or tip is probably a lot easier than you think.

Step 1: Fork

Head over to github.com and create a fork of this project. Our project page is [github.com/ngerakines/erlangquicktips](http://github.com/ngerakines/erlangquicktips).

Step 2: Add your snippet

Add a new snippet arcticle to the articles folder. If putting your name as the author isn't enough, add a quick signature to the end of the article. All articles should look something like this:

* Brief summary of what it does?
* Where did you find it?
* Show the snippet.
* Explain what it does.

Step 3: Commit and send a pull request

Commit the snippet or tip to your forked repository and make sure you send a pull request. From that point on someone with the ability to merge snippets/tips will look it over and push it up to the site.
