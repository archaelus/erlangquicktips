For an interview question I was given a small brain teaser: For a list o f lists whos elements form a spiral, follow the data structure and print out the list. I didn't think it would be that bad and gave it a shot. I ended up doing a few different things and this is the final result. It could probably be a lot cleaner but it does the job.
